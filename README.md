# Task_5-Exploratory-Data-Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# 🚢 Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis - Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Objective:
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and relationships in the data, especially those related to passenger survival.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files Included:
- `EDA_Titanic.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and observations.
- `Titanic Dataset Analysis.pdf` – PDF version of the notebook for easier viewing.
- `train.csv` – Titanic dataset (optional: you can mention it's from Kaggle if not uploaded).

## 📊 Key Insights:
- **Sex:** Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than males.
- **Class:** Passengers in 1st class had a better chance of survival.
- **Age:** Younger passengers were more likely to survive.
- **Fare:** Higher fares were linked with higher survival.
- **Correlation:** 'Fare' and 'Pclass' showed strong correlation with survival.

## 🔗 Dataset Source:

## 📝 How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run each cell to reproduce the analysis.
